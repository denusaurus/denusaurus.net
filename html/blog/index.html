		<h3>September debrief</h3>
		<p>I bought the HMD Barbie flipphone and tossed my iPhone 15 for a digital detox. I didn't actually toss it because I still need to migrate my apps and as infuriating as it is, the local public transport network can't make me a physical card for my annual pass that I have on their app. Also, it's not just a trendy detox, I do plan on sticking with this simpler tech lifestyle for the rest of my life basically. I celebrated my bday with my best friends and later with my family. My dad came to visit with his gf and it was actually lovely! I got a new tattoo, a matching one with my boyfriend (kinda), and I still haven't gotten used to it. I don't wanna say I regret it, because I realize it's my dad's voice telling me I'm a dissapointment, but it is a strong motif very much on the eyes. Whatever, I'll grow to love it. I took my boyfriend to Oslo and found the most amazing coffee in the world. I changed my OBGYN but I almost signed with a pro-life clinic at first (luckily the nurse told me about their morals, it's wild to me that a clinic can refuse to give you contraceptives...).</p>
