This is all public for now because I'm constantly asking people online for help

Thank you all for your time and patience. I love you romantically.

Everyone else, enjoy the code, LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES, and feel free to use any snippets you like. 
Please don't steal any of my artwork, I'm using this site as my professional portfolio. If you like any of my art, I'd love a shoutout on your page.
